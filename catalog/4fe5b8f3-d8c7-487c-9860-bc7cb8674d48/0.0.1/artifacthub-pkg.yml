    A simple prometheus-dummy-exporter container exposes a single Prometheus metric with a constant value. The metric name, value and port on which it will be served can be passed by flags.

    This container is then deployed in the same pod with another container, prometheus-to-sd, configured to use the same port. It scrapes the metric and publishes it to Stackdriver. This adapter isn't part of the sample code, but a standard component used by many Kubernetes applications. You can learn more about it  from given below link https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-stackdriver/tree/master/prometheus-to-sd

We designed the tool to be lean when deployed as a sidecar in your pod. It's intended to support only the metrics the Kubernetes team at Google needs and is not meant for end-users. \n ##h4 Caveats and Consideration \n"
