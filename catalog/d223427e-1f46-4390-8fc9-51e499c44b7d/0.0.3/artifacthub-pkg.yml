    K8GB ,commonly referred to as GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) solutions, has been typically the domain of proprietary network software and hardware vendors and installed and managed by siloed network teams.

    k8gb is a completely open source, cloud native, global load balancing solution for Kubernetes.

    k8gb focuses on load balancing traffic across geographically dispersed Kubernetes clusters using multiple load balancing strategies to meet requirements such as region failover for high availability.

    Global load balancing for any Kubernetes Service can now be enabled and managed by any operations or development teams in the same Kubernetes native way as any other custom resource.
